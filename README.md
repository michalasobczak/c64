# c64

Commodore C64 research and development.

- ANSI C development in ```cc65```
- ```DASM``` assembler for assembly language
- ```BASIC 2.0```

## Runtime

For development purposes use ```VICE``` emulator. Running on real hardware is preferable as well. Should either connect computer thru RF to TV set or use s-video connection to some USB frame grabber which seems to be the most comfortable way. ```VirtualDub``` does the job well.
